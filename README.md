### 🔭 Interest

I'm passionate about exploring cutting-edge technologies and their potential to solve real-world problems. Currently, my interests lie in the fields of Artificial General Intelligence, Multimodal Learning, Zero/One/Few-shot Learning, Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, Cognitive Science, and Bioinformatics.

In the past, I have worked on exciting projects in areas such as optical character recognition, single-camera depth prediction, object recognition and detection, and smoke removal in computer vision. I've also explored the use of computer vision in autonomous driving and flying. I'm always eager to expand my knowledge and have carried out various projects to solve social problems.

I believe that technology can be a powerful tool to make a positive impact on society, and I'm committed to leveraging my skills and experience to contribute to this goal.

### :notebook: Git

<!--
나는 computer science, computer engineering, and electrical engineering에 대한 전반적인 내용을 공부하는 git repository와 artificial intelligence, machine learning, deep learning, computer vision, natural language process에 대해 논문을 정리하는 git repositry를 정리하고 있다.
-->

I am organizing a git repository named [inyong37/Study](https://github.com/inyong37/Study) that studies general information such as books, frameworks, and concepts on computer science, computer engineering, and electrical engineering, and a git repository named [Soloura/Study](https://github.com/Soloura/Study) that organizes papers on artificial intelligence, machine learning, deep learning, computer vision, and natural language process.

I have a deep passion for open-source projects and collaborations, and I actively contribute whenever the opportunity arises. While my current contributions may be in smaller areas, such as documentation, my goal is to make increasingly impactful contributions over time. I believe in the power of collective efforts and the positive impact that open-source communities can have. I am excited to continue expanding my involvement and make substantial contributions that benefit the community as a whole.
